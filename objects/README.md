### One class to rule them All üòé
- Pull the changes to the quiz1 solutions(if you haven't üòâ)
```
$git pull origin develop
```
- Switch to the develop branch
```
$git checkout develop
```
- Create a new branch (feature-objects) from develop
```
$ git checkout -b feature-objects develop
```
#### Why OOP?
-Simplifies problem solving
-Modularity a.k.a divide & conquer
![Modularity](http://206.189.30.173/modularity.png)
-Speeds up development(Updates & teams)

#### How?
- Classes and Objects
  - Single responsibility

#### A Soft Introduction
  - Simple class that returns your browser details (TellMe.php)
    - Creating classes and objects,constructors & using classes

```
<?php
  /**
   * A simple PHP Class that returns your browser details
   */
  class TellMe{
    //class properties

    //class behaviors

      //constructor

      //method that returns browser details
  }
?>
```

#### Encouragement
> In learning OOP and design patterns for PHP, you need to remember a couple of points,
which were first made by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlis‚Äê
sides in Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software: _1). Designing object-oriented software is hard. 2). Designing reusable object-oriented software is even harder._. & **_The more difficult the knowledge is to obtain, the more it is valued._** üèãüèãüèãüèã
